//  Business rules NOT checked for by this validator:
//  TI-1: A TaskInstance must be associated with one and only one Task. (constrained by XC data model)
//  TI-2: If a TaskInstance's associated Task's taskType is `Recurring`, the TaskInstance is associated with one and only one TaskTargetSet. (validated by Task_Validator)
//  TI-3: If a TaskInstance's associated Task's taskType is `Specific`, the TaskInstance is not associated with a TaskTargetSet. (validated by Task_Validator)
//  TI-4: TaskInstances with the same associated Task must each have a unique date. (validated by Task_Validator)
