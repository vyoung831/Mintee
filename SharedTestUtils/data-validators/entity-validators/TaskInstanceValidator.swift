//  TI-2: If a TaskInstance's associated Task's taskType is `Recurring`, then the TaskInstance is associated with one and only one TaskTargetSet. (validated by TaskValidator)
//  TI-3: If a TaskInstance's associated Task's taskType is `Specific`, then the TaskInstance is not associated with a TaskTargetSet. (validated by TaskValidator)
//  TI-4: TaskInstances with the same associated Task each have a unique date. (validated by TaskValidator)
